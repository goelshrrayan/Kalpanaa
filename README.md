Insights

In India, women comprise about 30 percent of corporate senior management positions, which is notably higher than the global average (24 percent).

But in the overall workforce, India is one of the worst countries in the world — 113th out of 135 — when it comes to the gender gap. And women entrepreneurs constitute only 10 percent of the total number of entrepreneurs in the country.
